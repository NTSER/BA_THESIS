This is GitHub Repository for the paper: "Deriving political polarity from news articles in Georgia using Natural Language Processing"

Notes:
- All the websites was scraped using "Scrapy" library except tvpirveli.ge.
- Website of postv was changed and currently is shut down, so we only provide scraped data and not the scraping code, as it wont work.
- For saving the animation, requirements.txt is not sufficient, it additionaly requires downloading the "ffmpeg".
