# BA Thesis
This repository on GitHub pertains to the research paper titled "Deriving Political Polarity from News Articles in Georgia using Natural Language Processing."

Notes:

- The data from various websites was collected using the "Scrapy" library, with the exception of tvpirveli.ge.
- The website postv underwent changes and is currently inactive, therefore we only provide the scraped data and not the corresponding scraping code, as it would be non-functional.
- To save the animation, the requirements.txt file alone is not sufficient; the "ffmpeg" tool must also be downloaded additionally.
